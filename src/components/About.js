                Women Who WordPress is happening on October 27, 2018. We are now
                on our second year. Yay! This is open to all enthusiasts of
                WordPress and those who are interested to learn more about it.
                We will be having a track for beginner and advanced. This is a
                collaborative event between WordPress User Group Philippines and
                our community.
